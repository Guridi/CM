**Branching Strategy.

GithubFlow

We are using the "feature" branch to make any document text changes. Afterward, a commit is sumitted following by a pull request to the main branch.

**Semantic Versioning.

Major.Minor.Patch

Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.

**Pipeline Phases Descriptions.

The phases of our pipeline are:

1. Linter
2. Build
3. Test
4. DeployDev
5. DeployStage
6. DeployProd
